If you're running a C#-based project on GitHub, it could be useful to you - it takes your Xml comments and converts them into GitHub-flavoured markdown.  This gives you a nice document page right in your repo that you can link to.  I've set it up as a NuGet package, so in your C# project all you have to do is add the NuGet package to your project and it will add a post-build step to your project to automatically run the tool and generate the markdown file.  I was surprised that NuGet makes that a thing - apparently it's called custom .targets.  See &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pxtl/XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator/blob/master/PxtlCa.XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator.targets"&gt;https://github.com/Pxtl/XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator/blob/master/PxtlCa.XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator.targets&lt;/a&gt; to see how that kind of "custom post-build-step as a nuget package" thing is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was forked from &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/lontivero/593fc51f1208555112e0"&gt;https://gist.github.com/lontivero/593fc51f1208555112e0&lt;/a&gt;, but I'd like to think I've polished it up a fair bit.  This was really just a side-project while I worked on BigVariant and Nustache, but it's the one with the most stars and downloads so I thought I should give it a little TLC.  Pull requests are always welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
