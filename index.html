      <p>Hokay, taking a break from being awful arguing with strangers on the internet
(seriously folks it's a filthy habit I'd rather I smoked) to restart back on my
less-awful vice:</p>

<p><strong>Covid Cocktails</strong></p>

<p>For the winter holiday, I decided to do another round of Covid Cocktails.  This
time I'm trying to do something thematic - a focus on savory cocktails... and of
course, some festive ones too, because it's that time of the year.</p>

      <p>After a break, I'm back with a 3rd round of Covid cocktails.  First off, I
finished off the sweet vermouth and bought some proper Dolin. </p>

<p>Also, Collective Arts gin is pretty expensive as London dry gins go, but I
bought myself a bottle as a treat... and then my wife bought me another bottle
as a birthday present.  So I have a lot of gin to use.</p>

      <p>Okay, so let me just make sure I'm getting the latest City of Hamilton council
misadventure straight.  It's been hard to keep track of this overlaid in all the
pandemic pandemonium.  </p>

<p><strong>edit (2020-10-12)</strong>: Thanks to Ryan McGreal for helping me out with some details.</p>

<p>Cameron Kroetsch is a local activist who is an unpaid volunteer on the city's
LGBT advisory committee.  He's butt heads with the city before, like when said
the city shouldn't fly the rainbow flag during Pride because they hadn't really
stood up for the city's LGBT community properly. This attitude of his was
vindicated when the police failed to protect the Gage park pride event from
violent homophobic activists, despite (according to Kroetsch) having been
specifically told exactly where and when to be.  The police defend this because
Pride's leadership had asked the police not to patrol the interior of the event
or set up a recruiting table (the violence was on the edge of the park).</p>

      <p>Continuing on from my previous round, I've done another 14 days of cocktails.
This time it's a more '70s theme.</p>

      <p>So thanks to watching too many "How to Drink" Youtube videos, I've gotten into
mixing cocktails.  We're all drinking at home anyways, right?</p>

<p>So I made approximately one cocktail per day, mostly things I've never tried
before.</p>

      <p>So I'm finally getting myself a new computer.  Had it all figured out - new
off-lease desktops were coming available for my kids, and I was going to buy
myself a brand-new gaming machine.  No hard feelings because everybody's getting
a new machine at once.</p>

<p>Just had to wait until August.</p>

<p>Which is why it's awesome that my kids' computer (named Uranus) died.  And died in an
infuriating way - it was murdered by its own software.</p>

      <p>Continuing on our marathon process of setting up the perfect Mineclone2 server,
this is going to be a brief side-guide - how set up skins in mineclone 2.  I
tried several approaches to this problem - the popular  skin mods in minetest
are meant to manage a connection to an online database of skins, and I just
wanted to pre-load enough skins so the kids would have a library to choose from.</p>

<p>I couldn't get any of the existing skins mods to work fully, so we're going to
just set the files up manually.</p>

      <p>Now that we've got our Minetest server built (see <a href="/2020/05/12/minetest-pi4-recipe/">previous

install mods and games into it, and how to run multiple instances of minetest.
In particular, we're going to be installing Mineclone 2.</p>

      <p>Continuing from my <a href="/2020/05/05/minetest-birthday/">previous article</a> on my
daughter's Minetest birthday party, here's how I built my Raspberry Pi 4
minetest server that powered the party.  To be clear: this is only my second
time this century setting up a linux-based server from scratch, so I'm pretty
novice at this.  I'm handy with a terminal console but only on Windows.  The
intended reader of this article is... well, somebody like me.  Somebody new to
Linux but very comfy with Windows.</p>

      <p>Okay, this is part one of a multi-part... well, I guess we can't use the term
"postmortem" that's popular in software development, since it's kind of morbid
for a birthday.  We'll call it an "after-action report".</p>

<p>Basically, we had to handle the challenge of "how do you run a 10th birthday
party with kids under social distancing"?  My answer was cupcakes, Zoom, a
Raspberry Pi 4, and the open-source clone of Minecraft called
<a href="https://www.minetest.net">Minetest</a>.</p>
