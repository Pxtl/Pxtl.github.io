      <p>So thanks to watching too many "How to Drink" Youtube videos, I've gotten into
mixing cocktails.  We're all drinking at home anyways, right?</p>

<p>So I made approximately one cocktail per day, mostly things I've never tried
before.</p>

      <p>So I'm finally getting myself a new computer.  Had it all figured out - new
off-lease desktops were coming available for my kids, and I was going to buy
myself a brand-new gaming machine.  No hard feelings because everybody's getting
a new machine at once.</p>

<p>Just had to wait until August.</p>

<p>Which is why it's awesome that my kids' computer (named Uranus) died.  And died in an
infuriating way - it was murdered by its own software.</p>

      <p>Continuing on our marathon process of setting up the perfect Mineclone2 server,
this is going to be a brief side-guide - how set up skins in mineclone 2.  I
tried several approaches to this problem - the popular  skin mods in minetest
are meant to manage a connection to an online database of skins, and I just
wanted to pre-load enough skins so the kids would have a library to choose from.</p>

<p>I couldn't get any of the existing skins mods to work fully, so we're going to
just set the files up manually.</p>

      <p>Now that we've got our Minetest server built (see <a href="/2020/05/12/minetest-pi4-recipe/">previous

install mods and games into it, and how to run multiple instances of minetest.
In particular, we're going to be installing Mineclone 2.</p>

      <p>Continuing from my <a href="/2020/05/05/minetest-birthday/">previous article</a> on my
daughter's Minetest birthday party, here's how I built my Raspberry Pi 4
minetest server that powered the party.  To be clear: this is only my second
time this century setting up a linux-based server from scratch, so I'm pretty
novice at this.  I'm handy with a terminal console but only on Windows.  The
intended reader of this article is... well, somebody like me.  Somebody new to
Linux but very comfy with Windows.</p>

      <p>Okay, this is part one of a multi-part... well, I guess we can't use the term
"postmortem" that's popular in software development, since it's kind of morbid
for a birthday.  We'll call it an "after-action report".</p>

<p>Basically, we had to handle the challenge of "how do you run a 10th birthday
party with kids under social distancing"?  My answer was cupcakes, Zoom, a
Raspberry Pi 4, and the open-source clone of Minecraft called
<a href="https://www.minetest.net">Minetest</a>.</p>

      <p>What with covid-19, a lot of people are remoting and not a lot of people have
webcams. But everybody's got a smartphone. So here's a guide on how to use your
smartphone as a webcam with Android an Windows over wifi.</p>

<p>This is pretty adminny. If you're not comfy with that you might need to look at
other approaches.</p>

<p>One important wrinkle is performance: It runs down the battery on my phone, and
it slams the CPU on my desktop with interrupts.</p>

<p><strong>Note that none of the software I'm recommending in this guide is open-source.
I cannot guarantee that the software discussed below has no malicious secret

It's a simple wrapper that allows you to rebind a DInput gamepad as an XInput gamepad.<br />
Since most games are standardized on XInput (XBox360 controllers), 
this allows you to make an existing gamepad masquerade as an XBox360 controller. </p>

        <span>posted on 22 Feb 2017</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>The city has told us that the York and Dundurn bike lanes may need to be removed as York and Dundurn must carry westbound automotive traffic that will no longer fit on LRT-equipped King Street.</p>

<p>Since everyone else has thrown a design out there for saving the York bike track, I thought I'd do the same.</p>

<p>There are a handful of cities that have implemented centre-aligned bike lanes.  There are some advantages to this flow: Drivers expect to see oncoming traffic on the left.  In one-way traffic like Cannon, this means putting the cycle track on the left side (south for Cannon).  In a two-way street, this means using the centre - it's on the left for both directions of traffic.  This allows us to unify the two bike lanes into a  single protected bidirectional cycle track without having oncoming traffic on the right.</p>

<p>Also, a feature very particular to York and Cannon; Cannon merges with York Boulevard at Queen to form a single road.  The Cannon lanes, if continued, would end in the centre of this road.  So let's see what that looks like: The Cannon lanes continue right to Queen, and only have to deal with left-turning traffic turning across the bike lane.  </p>

      <p>I'm an idiot.  Always commit everything.  Always.  And only push your build artifacts, not straight from the project.</p>

<p>I omitted the crucial line of the .nuspec that makes the .targets thing work, and so the cool build-generates-your-markdown wasn't actually available for users since version 0.1.5977.1837.<br />
The latest version 0.2.6130.564 fixes the issue.</p>

<p>A lesson learned, but I wonder how many people I infuriated in the meantime?</p>
