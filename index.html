        <a href="/2020/04/08/ip-webcam/">Using your phone as a Webcam on Windows and Android</a> 
        <span>posted on 08 Apr 2020</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>What with covid-19, a lot of people are remoting and not a lot of people have
webcams. But everybody's got a smartphone. So here's a guide on how to use your
smartphone as a webcam with Android an Windows over wifi.</p>

<p>This is pretty adminny. If you're not comfy with that you might need to look at
other approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Note that none of the software I'm recommending in this guide is open-source.
I cannot guarantee that the software discussed below has no malicious secret
intent.</strong></p>

<h2>Setting up your phone as a server</h2>

<p>First, you need to get your Android phone onto a static IP. So go to Settings ->
About -> Status to find your Wi-fi MAC address, and in your router's DHCP/LAN
settings, you need to bind that address to a fixed IP. Also take note of <em>which</em>
wifi network your phone lives on, if you have more than one in your home or
workplace.</p>

<p>Next, you need to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&amp;hl=en_CA">IP
Webcam</a>
on your android phone. This turns your phone into a video server - which is why
it needs a static IP. Run IP Webcam.</p>

<h3>Recommended settings:</h3>

<ul>
<li>IP WEBCAM SETTINGS -> Video Preferences
<ul>
<li>Set the "main" camera to the front-facing camera. I know the rear-camera is
better but this is just easier to set up.</li>
<li>Set the "Video Resolution" to 640x480 or lower. I found performance problems
at higher resolution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CONNECTION SETTINGS -> Local Broadcasting
<ul>
<li>Set a Login and Password.</li>
<li>I'm assuming your network is secure so we're not going to fuss with SSL, I
couldn't make SSL work.</li>
<li>Just to be safe, don't get naked in front of your phone while it's running
the server</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on "run in background":</h3>

<p>IP WebCam has the option to run in background, but I found the notification icon
that indicates this is happening easy-to-miss and so it would be very easy to
accidentally leave it broadcasting your life. It does save power because you can
shut down the video view and do other things while it's streaming, but I
recommend not using it. If power is a problem, get a power-cable for your
computer desk.</p>

<h3>Starting it up</h3>

<p>Now that your settings are confirmed, click "start server". It will show the
live video from your phoen that it is broadcasting, along with the address if
the webserver your phone is running - eg http://192.168.1.X:8080. Note that this
is <em>not</em> the address of the raw stream, but of a website you can use to
configure your device. Feel free to hit that address with your browser to try
it.</p>

<p>The actual video feed lives at http://192.168.1.X:8080/video. Note the /video
directory. It's over HTTP, so again you can hit it with your browser. You'll be
prompted for username and password.</p>

<p>Leave the server running while we set up the client.</p>

<h2>Setting up your Windows PC as a client</h2>

<p>First, confirm that your Windows PC is on the same WiFi network as your phone.</p>

<p>Now we install the client software. We're using <a href="https://ip-webcam.appspot.com/">IP Camera
Adapter</a> which will allow you to connect your
Windows PC to the HTTP videostream and use it as a webcam.</p>

<p>Install the software. When completed, open the app "Configure IP Camera Adapter"
that is now present in your start menu.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<ol>
<li>Type in the camera feed URL - remember this is the one that ends in "/video".
So in total it should be something like http://192.168.1.X:8080/video . 2)
Key in your username and password.</li>
<li>Click "Autodetect" - this will test our connection to your phone and read in
its resolution. It should match whatever you set back in the server setup
step.</li>
<li>OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now use your video-chat program of choice's "video test" tool to confirm it
works.</p>

<p>Did it work? Yay!</p>

<p>No? You're on your own, bud.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<p>I find it best to keep my video stream <em>off</em> and just keep the button to turn my
phone into a camera on my phone's home-screen. You will see a wierd backwards
text in your video-feed if your computer cannot reach the phone. So when a
videochat starts, I open the app, scroll to the bottom and click "start", and
then put my phone in place to work as a camera.</p>

<p>Remember that the camera mode does run down the battery, so it may be handy to
have a charge-cable near whatever cradle-like setup you've rigged for your phone
at your desk.</p>

It's a simple wrapper that allows you to rebind a DInput gamepad as an XInput gamepad.<br />
Since most games are standardized on XInput (XBox360 controllers), 
this allows you to make an existing gamepad masquerade as an XBox360 controller. </p>

        <a href="/2017/02/22/yorkblvdcentrebikelane/">York Boulevard Centre-aligned Bike Track</a> 
        <span>posted on 22 Feb 2017</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>The city has told us that the York and Dundurn bike lanes may need to be removed as York and Dundurn must carry westbound automotive traffic that will no longer fit on LRT-equipped King Street.</p>

<p>Since everyone else has thrown a design out there for saving the York bike track, I thought I'd do the same.</p>

<p>There are a handful of cities that have implemented centre-aligned bike lanes.  There are some advantages to this flow: Drivers expect to see oncoming traffic on the left.  In one-way traffic like Cannon, this means putting the cycle track on the left side (south for Cannon).  In a two-way street, this means using the centre - it's on the left for both directions of traffic.  This allows us to unify the two bike lanes into a  single protected bidirectional cycle track without having oncoming traffic on the right.</p>

<p>Also, a feature very particular to York and Cannon; Cannon merges with York Boulevard at Queen to form a single road.  The Cannon lanes, if continued, would end in the centre of this road.  So let's see what that looks like: The Cannon lanes continue right to Queen, and only have to deal with left-turning traffic turning across the bike lane.  </p>

      <p>I'm an idiot.  Always commit everything.  Always.  And only push your build artifacts, not straight from the project.</p>

<p>I omitted the crucial line of the .nuspec that makes the .targets thing work, and so the cool build-generates-your-markdown wasn't actually available for users since version 0.1.5977.1837.<br />
The latest version 0.2.6130.564 fixes the issue.</p>

<p>A lesson learned, but I wonder how many people I infuriated in the meantime?</p>

      <p>I've released version 0.2 of <a href="https://github.com/Pxtl/XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator">XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator</a>.  If you're running a C#-based project on GitHub, it could be useful to you - it takes your Xml comments and converts them into GitHub-flavoured markdown.  This gives you a nice document page right in your repo that you can link to.  I've set it up as a NuGet package, so in your C# project all you have to do is add the NuGet package to your project and it will add a post-build step to your project to automatically run the tool and generate the markdown file.  I was surprised that NuGet makes that a thing - apparently it's called custom .targets.  See <a href="https://github.com/Pxtl/XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator/blob/master/PxtlCa.XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator.targets">https://github.com/Pxtl/XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator/blob/master/PxtlCa.XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator.targets</a> to see how that kind of "custom post-build-step as a nuget package" thing is implemented.</p>

<p>It was forked from <a href="https://gist.github.com/lontivero/593fc51f1208555112e0">https://gist.github.com/lontivero/593fc51f1208555112e0</a>, but I'd like to think I've polished it up a fair bit.  This was really just a side-project while I worked on BigVariant and Nustache, but it's the one with the most stars and downloads so I thought I should give it a little TLC.  Pull requests are always welcome. </p>
