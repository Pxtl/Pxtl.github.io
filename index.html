      <p>Even though I just finished a round of cocktails around Christmas, in honor of
New Year's Eve I pivoted right into Covid Cocktails round 5.  The main reason
was sparkling wine, so there's a lot of it here.</p>

<h1>14 Days of New Year's Cocktails</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>The <strong>Pineapple Fizz</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5oz white rum</li>
<li>0.5oz dark rum</li>
<li>1.25oz pineapple juice</li>
<li>0.75oz lime juice</li>
<li>0.75oz simple syrup</li>
<li>2 dashes angostura</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake with ice, </p>

<p>pour to Collins' w ice, </p>

<p>top with club soda</p>

<p>First off, let me just thank my wife for the silicone big block ice cube tray
for Christmas. Look at this absolute unit. Big cubes aren't just for show,
they're important in the shaker too, they provide some real weight when smashing
things around in there.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/pineapple-fizz.jpg" alt="Pineapple Fizz" /></p>

<p>The drink is fun. Tangy and funky with the rum, Angostura, and pineapple flavors
playing together.</p>

<p>The lime got lost a bit, but that's okay - it's still adding things to the drink
even when it's not standing out. Wife said it was nice but her favourites are
still the sours where the citrus takes center stage.</p>

<p>Aside, I'm not planning on doing a full 14 days of cocktails this time, but
maybe 6-9 of them or until I run out of recipes (edit: I did the full 14).  We
just picked up a bottle of champagne for new year's so I've got a bunch of
things I want to try.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>Covid Cocktails 5, day 2: in honor of MPP Rod Phillips' return to Canada and
resignation, a festive seasonal drink:</p>

<p>A <strong>mojito</strong>.</p>

<p>In a glass, add:
- 1oz lemon juice
- 0.5oz simple
- Several leaves mint</p>

<p>Muddle the mint.</p>

<p>Add:
- 2oz white Cuban rum
- Ice
- Seltzer to top.</p>

<p>Stir, garnish w mint</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/mojito.jpg" alt="Mojito" /></p>

<p>Properly a mojito calls for lime, not lemon, but I was out. Mojitos were my
go-to drink on trips to Cuba and one of the only real cocktails I had a lot of
before this year.</p>

<p>I think an important part is that the drink needs to sit for a bit for the mint
to really seep in.</p>

<p>First swig right after making it is just a Rum Collins with a mint garnish
smushed against your nose. But if you let the mint work in, it's very nice.</p>

<p>Of course, in the hot Cuban sun that means a super watered down drink as all the
ice melts, so I don't know how this works.</p>

<p>Also, again thanks to my wife for the fancy silicone ice forms kit for Christmas
- observe the spherical ice non-cubes!</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>Now we're getting into the cocktails I made on New Year's Eve, because
champagne.  Well, sparkling wine.</p>

<p>First, the <strong>barracuda</strong>.</p>

<p>In shaker
- 1.5oz Cuban white rum
- 0.5oz Galliano
- 1.5oz pineapple
- 0.25oz lime</p>

<p>shake, strain to glass, and top with</p>

<ul>
<li>1oz brut sparkling wine</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/barracuda.jpg" alt="Barracuda" /></p>

<p>This is nice.  The vanilla is a bit subdued, so it's kind of a fizzy pineapple
mimosa - like a less-sweet, wine-tinged version of the Pineapple Fizz I did the
other day.  The rum is mostly a spike.  Made it for my wife and she enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Double-straining into a champagne flute is <em>really</em> hard, and made a mess all
over the counter-top.  After that I completely forgot to garnish with a slice of
pineapple.</p>

<h2>Day 4</h2>

<p>We get weird with NYE cocktails, with Difford's "<strong>Ramos Chocolate Fizz</strong>".</p>

<p>In shaker:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5oz gin</li>
<li>1.0oz chocolate liquer</li>
<li>barspoon orange flower water</li>
<li>barspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
<li>1oz single cream</li>
</ul>

<p>Dry shake, </p>

<p>Then shake with ice.</p>

<p>Double-strain to flute,</p>

<p>Top with</p>

<ul>
<li>1oz sparkling wine</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/Ramos-chocolate-fizz.jpg" alt="Ramos Chocolate
Fizz" /></p>

<p>Daughter was curious and sniffed it as I was pouring it. Her nose wrinkled and
she exclaimed "It smells like unicorn vomit!".</p>

<p>Having drank it... she's not wrong.  Gin fizz foam but with added vanilla and
chocolate and more orange flower water.  Chocolate and gin &amp; very strong floral
notes and champagne fizz... It's kind of a hot mess.</p>

<p>Maybe I need better ingredients - better wine, 1.5oz proper white creme de cacao
instead of the 1.0oz 360 double-chocolate vodka.</p>

<p>Either way, orange flower water is pretty strong and gives it a very floral
taste over the chocolate, especially combined with the gin herbs.  It kind of
reminded me of Walker's Chocolates' lavender-flavored milk-chocolate truffles.
I wasn't a fan of those either.</p>

<p>Maybe cleaning up after Twilight Sparkle is somebody's thing, but it isn't mine.</p>

<h2>Day 5</h2>

<p>The classic sparkling wine cocktail, the <strong>French 75</strong>,
AKA the Soixante Quinze, named after the artillery weapon.</p>

<p>In a shaker:
- 1.5oz gin
- 0.75oz lemon
- 0.5oz simple syrup</p>

<p>Shake with ice, pour to glass, top with sparkling wine. Garnish with a twist.</p>

<p>So it's basically a gin sour with champagne on top.  </p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/French-75.jpg" alt="French 75" /></p>

<p>Considering how similar it is to a Tom Collins I expected not to like it... I
was wrong.  This is fantastic.  The gin shines through the bubbly and the
flavors come together really well.</p>

<p>I did cheat a bit - I served it in a flute instead of a Collins glass with ice,
and I gave it a quick stir with the bar-spoon after topping it up.</p>

<p>Still fantastic.</p>

<p>No ragrets.</p>

<h2>Day 6</h2>

<p>Of course we can't do champagne cocktails without the brunch fixture, the mimosa.</p>

<ul>
<li>3oz OJ</li>
<li>3oz sparkling wine</li>
<li>cherry for garnish</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/mimosa.jpg" alt="mimosa" /></p>

<p>It's what you'd expect - the OJ and sparkling wine goes together perfectly nice.
Sweet and bubbly and citrus. Very light. The cherry does add a nice note - I
really like these Amarena cherries I got for Christmas, oozing purple to the
bottom.  </p>

<p>Also, cherries don't float, it's standing on a skewer.</p>

<h2>Day 7</h2>

<p>The <strong>old Cuban</strong>.</p>

<p>In a shaker:</p>

<p>Muddle 6+ leaves mint, </p>

<p>add</p>

<ul>
<li>0.5oz simple syrup,</li>
</ul>

<p>let stand while hunting for ingredients.</p>

<p>Add:</p>

<ul>
<li>0.75oz lime</li>
<li>1.5oz Cuban rum</li>
<li>2 dashes Angostura bitters</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake with ice, pour to glass</p>

<p>top with sparkling wine, </p>

<p>garnish with mint.</p>

<p>So it's basically a Mojito Royale.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/old-Cuban.jpg" alt="old Cuban" /></p>

<p>Tasty.  Letting the mint sit in the syrup released its flavors well.  Strong
mint flavors this time, which nicely complimented the lime and sparkling wine.</p>

<p>Although double-straining into a flute sucks and a lot ended up on the counter.</p>

<h2>Day 8</h2>

<p>Taking a break from watching the last days of Rome for another light mimosa-esque drink, this time with black currant - the <strong>kir royale</strong>.</p>

<p>Build in glass:</p>

<ul>
<li>1oz creme de cassis</li>
<li>top with sparkling wine</li>
</ul>

<p>stir, garnish with raspberries</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/kir-royale.jpg" alt="kir royale" /></p>

<p>Not much to it, perfectly nice, sweet, tasty drink. The liqueur has kind of a
forgettable non-specific berry flavor, and that mixes well with the bubbly.</p>

<h2>Day 9</h2>

<p>Covid Cocktails 5, day 9: My final sparkling wine New Year's drink - I think I
made this on the 4th with the last of the bubbly... the <strong>poinsettia</strong>.</p>

<p>Chill all ingredients in freezer, </p>

<p>build in a glass:</p>

<ul>
<li>0.75oz triple sec</li>
<li>3oz cranberry cocktail</li>
<li>fill to top with bubbly</li>
</ul>

<p>Garnish with a sprig of rosemary.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/poinsettia.jpg" alt="poinsettia" /></p>

<p>Greg from How to Drink called this kind of one-note and boring, but it's a good
note.</p>

<p>The triple sec adds a fun tang to the cranberry, the champagne fizz puts it
together nicely, and the smell of the rosemary complements the sweet drink very
well.  I liked this a lot.</p>

<h2>Day 10</h2>

<p><strong>Gin and tonic</strong>.  Which I've had before at a bar, but this time I'm using proper
ingredients. build in rocks glass over ice:</p>

<ul>
<li>2oz gin</li>
<li>5oz fever tree cucumber tonic water (or whatever, I'm guesstimating)</li>
<li>lemon twist and wedge for garnish</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/gin-and-tonic.jpg" alt="gin and tonic" /></p>

<p>Very nice.  So many flavors going on... the cucumber tonic water isn't as bitter
as some, and adds some nice subtle cucumber notes to the gin and quinine
flavors.  The lemon nose from the garnish is a good opener too.  Lime would be
better but I'd already started a lemon.</p>

<h2>Day 11</h2>

<p>I return to the Tequila Sunrise with the <strong>executive sunrise</strong>.</p>

<p>Build in a glass:
- 2oz reposado tequila
- 5oz orange juice</p>

<p>stir, then add:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 barspoons creme de cassis on top</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/executive-sunrise.jpg" alt="executive sunrise" /></p>

<p>It definitely looked better than the black sun I made last time around.  Creme de cassis left lovely swirls in the drink as it sinks to the bottom.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this means the best flavor is at the bottom.  OJ and tequila alone isn't great.  But stirring would ruin the effect.  Maybe a better OJ like fresh cara cara would make it work, and scale the whole thing down.</p>

<p>Or I should just use a straw.</p>

<h2>Day 12</h2>

<p>The <strong>eastside</strong>, which is a variation on a <em>southside</em>, which is a gin sour
with mint.</p>

<p>With a peeler take 2 lengthwise slices of cucumber</p>

<p>In a shaker,</p>

<ul>
<li>6 leaves mint</li>
<li>1 long cucumber slice</li>
<li>0.5oz simple syrup</li>
</ul>

<p>Muddle, then add</p>

<ul>
<li>2oz gin</li>
<li>1oz lime</li>
<li>ice</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake, pour to glass, garnish with cucumber roll.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/eastside.jpg" alt="eastside" /></p>

<p>So it's basically a gin sour with added mint and cucumber.  After my G&amp;T, I
liked the idea of cucumber with gin.  Unfortunately, I couldn't taste the
cucumber.  So it was more of a southside - a minty gin sour... which is a flavor I
liked better with rum.</p>

<p>The roll garnish fell into the drink, and I pulled it out and ate it.  It was
surprisingly good.</p>

<p>Maybe I need a different kind of cucumber for this, or put more thicker cucumber
into the shaker.  I dunno.</p>

<h2>Day 13</h2>

<p>The Honeysuckle Daiquiri.  A rum-based variant of the Bees Knees.</p>

<ul>
<li>2oz Cuban rum</li>
<li>0.66oz lemon juice</li>
<li>0.33oz orange juice</li>
<li>0.5oz honey syrup</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake with ice, </p>

<p>double-strain to glass, </p>

<p>garnish with mint.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/honeysuckle-daiquiri.jpg" alt="honeysuckle daiquiri" /></p>

<p>I thought I would like this more than the Bees Knees since all the fruit and
honey is up... and the first sip was lovely... but as I got further into it, it
had this weird funky decay flavor to it, despite fresh ingredients.  Well,
canned concentrated OJ but fresh from the freezer.  Just the combination of
honey, rum, and orange came out... wrong.</p>

<p>Again, I suppose I should be squeezing fresh oranges but I don't need another
bar-tool (they don't fit in the lemon squeezer very well).</p>

<h2>Day 14</h2>

<p>Okay, usually I end with a bang but I kind of started this round on a whim with
less time to research and hunt for ingredients because sparkling wine, so my
final cocktail is really just about using up stuff taking up space in my fridge.</p>

<p>So, I made a simple Vermouth Cassis - a cocktail where the name kind of makes
the ingredients obvious. Build in a glass over ice:</p>

<ul>
<li>3oz dry French vermouth</li>
<li>0.75oz creme de cassis</li>
<li>3oz club soda</li>
<li>garnish with cherries because why not?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2021-01-24-Covid-cocktails-5/vermouth-cassis.jpg" alt="vermouth cassis" /></p>

<p>It tastes like a ice-wine pop, with a hint of cherry and black currant.  Not
bad.  The cherries were a good idea, added a bit more to the black currant of
the cassis.  I'd make this again if I ever had leftover vermouth and cassis to
use up.</p>

      <p>Hokay, taking a break from being awful arguing with strangers on the internet
(seriously folks it's a filthy habit I'd rather I smoked) to restart back on my
less-awful vice:</p>

<p><strong>Covid Cocktails</strong></p>

<p>For the winter holiday, I decided to do another round of Covid Cocktails.  This
time I'm trying to do something thematic - a focus on savory cocktails... and of
course, some festive ones too, because it's that time of the year.</p>

      <p>After a break, I'm back with a 3rd round of Covid cocktails.  First off, I
finished off the sweet vermouth and bought some proper Dolin. </p>

<p>Also, Collective Arts gin is pretty expensive as London dry gins go, but I
bought myself a bottle as a treat... and then my wife bought me another bottle
as a birthday present.  So I have a lot of gin to use.</p>

<p><strong>edit (2020-10-12)</strong>: Thanks to Ryan McGreal for helping me out with some details.</p>

<p>Cameron Kroetsch is a local activist who is an unpaid volunteer on the city's
LGBT advisory committee.  He's butt heads with the city before, like when said
the city shouldn't fly the rainbow flag during Pride because they hadn't really
stood up for the city's LGBT community properly. This attitude of his was
vindicated when the police failed to protect the Gage park pride event from
violent homophobic activists, despite (according to Kroetsch) having been
specifically told exactly where and when to be.  The police defend this because
Pride's leadership had asked the police not to patrol the interior of the event
or set up a recruiting table (the violence was on the edge of the park).</p>

This time it's a more '70s theme.</p>

      <p>So thanks to watching too many "How to Drink" Youtube videos, I've gotten into
mixing cocktails.  We're all drinking at home anyways, right?</p>

<p>So I made approximately one cocktail per day, mostly things I've never tried

      <p>So I'm finally getting myself a new computer.  Had it all figured out - new

a new machine at once.</p>

      <p>Continuing from my <a href="/2020/05/05/minetest-birthday/">previous article</a> on my
daughter's Minetest birthday party, here's how I built my Raspberry Pi 4
minetest server that powered the party.  To be clear: this is only my second
time this century setting up a linux-based server from scratch, so I'm pretty
novice at this.  I'm handy with a terminal console but only on Windows.  The
intended reader of this article is... well, somebody like me.  Somebody new to
Linux but very comfy with Windows.</p>
