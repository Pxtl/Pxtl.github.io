    <p>Now that we've got our Minetest server built (see <a href="/2020/05/12/minetest-pi4-recipe/">previous
entry</a> ), now it's time to learn how to
install mods and games into it, and how to run multiple instances of minetest.
In particular, we're going to be installing Mineclone 2.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<h1>Mods and Games in Minetest</h1>

<p>First off, you have to understand how minetest manages content.  Minetest has
two concepts: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>mods</strong>: small bits of code that will add one feature to a game.</li>
<li><strong>games</strong>: big, mutually-exclusive affairs that will bundle many mods together
and act as a basis for more mods.  Also sometimes called a "subgame".</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, we have to consider two <strong>games</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Minetest Game</strong>: the basic standard game for Minetest.  It's a
hyper-simplified version of Minecraft with no mobs or anything.   This is the
basis for most Minetest mods - most Minetest mods are only playable on
<strong>Minetest game</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Mineclone 2</strong>: a game for mineclone that makes the game stylistically and
gameplay-wise as similar to Minecraft as is feasible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minetest games and mods are typically downloaded from the Minetest <a href="https://content.minetest.net/">Content
DB</a>), which has a nice, easy-to-use browser built
into Minetest.</p>

<p>However, the contentDB downloader is designed to be used from the offline client
- it can be executed within our online dedicated server running on the Pi4.  So
  we have to deploy the mods and games into Minetest <em>manually</em>.  Fortunately,
  it's not as bad as all that.</p>

<h1>Mods and Games in minetest-server on Raspbian/Debian</h1>

<p>The meat of the work we're going to be doing is in
<code>/var/games/minetest-server/.minetest</code>.  Note that <code>.minetest</code> is a dot-folder,
and so is hidden from <code>ls</code> unless you use <code>ls -a</code>.</p>

<p>There are three directories within the "minetest" directory that we care about.</p>

<pre><code>.minetest    
├── games
├── mods
└── worlds
    └── world
</code></pre>

<p>These same three directories exist on your local copy of minetest running on
your Windows machine (or Android tablet), and will contain the same kind of
files.</p>

<p>What this means is that you can download and debug mods using the "Content DB"
system in the minetest client, and then deploy the packaged-up game or world up
to the minetest server.</p>

<p>However, to start we're going to keep it simple.  We're going to download
MineClone 2, create a world with it, and then deploy it to our server.</p>

<h2>Warning about the worlds folder</h2>

<p>Until we're setting up multiple servers and I'll go into more details, a word of
warning: The only folder in your <code>worlds</code> folder on the Pi4 minetest-server can
be <code>world</code>.  We'll get into more elaborate changes later.  For now - if you put
anything else in that folder, minetest-server stops working.</p>

<h1>Getting Started with MineClone 2</h1>

<p><a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=16407">MineClone 2 can be downloaded from the minetest
forum</a> where its development
is publicly run, but <a href="https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/">it can also be obtained from
contentdb</a>, and the
forum crashes pretty often.</p>

<p>Download it and unzip it into your <code>minetest\games</code> folder on your Windows PC.
Or you can fetch it from minetest contentdb itself, but we're going to use the
process I used when setting up.  So, for example, if minetest is in <code>c:\games</code>,
then you should have <code>c:\games\minetest\games\mineclone2</code>.  Remember this is an
opensource project, which means linux, which means case-sensitive filepaths. Get
used to thinking in all-lower-case.</p>

<p>Create a new world in minetest, using "Start Game" --> "New"</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-05-23-Minetest-mods/minetest-new-world.jpg" alt="Minetest new world
screen" /></p>

<p>Select the "MineClone 2" game, provide a seed (I recommend <code>6</code>, because I found
it had a pleasent starting area) and a name (call it "world" - I'll explain why
later), and click "Create". This will make our new Mineclone world.</p>

<p>Now we have the mod and the world running on our local copy of Minetest and we
can deploy it to our server.</p>

<h1>Deploying MineClone 2 and our new World</h1>

<h2>Moving files onto the Pi4</h2>

<p>We'll be using <code>WinSCP</code> to copy the files to our server.  We can't deploy them
<em>direct</em> to the target location because of permissions, so we'll copy them to
the "downloads" folder and then go from there.</p>

<p>Use <code>WinSCP</code> and your <code>pi</code> credentials to connect to the pi server.  Let's
create a "minetest" folder under <code>/home/pi/Downloads</code> (aka <code>~/Downloads</code>). Then,
move our world and the game in there using the WinSCP upload command.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-05-23-Minetest-mods/winscp.jpg" alt="WinSCP" /></p>

<p>So after uploading, we should have <code>/home/pi/Downloads/minetest/world</code> and
<code>/home/pi/Downloads/minetest/mineclone2</code>.</p>

<h2>Moving files around on the Pi4</h2>

<p>Now that's the end of GUI work, time to switch to our console.  Connect a
terminal to the Pi4 server using PutTTY.  We're going to copy some files around.</p>

<p>First, we have to stop our minetest server so that it doesn't complain when we
start moving things around.  <code>sudo systemctl stop minetest-server</code>.  Our
minetest server is shut down.</p>

<p>Now let's get started with the files <code>cd /var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/</code>
and then <code>sudo mkdir backup</code>. We're going to make a backup folder for our extra
worlds and the like. Next we have to remove the existing world so we can replace
it with our mineclone2 world.  <code>sudo mv ./worlds/world/ backup</code> will move the
world into the backup folder.</p>

<p>Next, let's move in our new world and our new game.</p>

<p>If there isn't a folder called <code>games</code> yet, <code>sudo mkdir games</code>.  Next, we'll
bring in mineclone2:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /home/pi/Downloads/minetest/mineclone2 ./games/
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we'll bring in our world</p>

<pre><code>sudo mv /home/pi/Downloads/minetest/world ./worlds/
</code></pre>

<p>Now we've copied the files over.</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>Now we have to transfer ownership of these 2 folders to the minetest-server
user, <code>Debian-minetest</code> of group <code>games</code>.</p>

<pre><code> sudo chown Debian-minetest:games ./games/mineclone2 -R
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-R</code> means <code>--recursive</code>.  Now the world</p>

<pre><code> sudo chown Debian-minetest:games ./games/world -R
</code></pre>

<p>And now we're ready.   Let's restart the server.</p>

<h2>Restart the World</h2>

<pre><code>sudo systemctl start minetest-server
</code></pre>

<p>And we're up.  On your desktop minetest, connect to the server.</p>

<p>Note that by default minetest stores credentials inside the world folder so we
blew away all our users... you might have to restart with fresh users again.</p>

<p>You should find your world up and running.</p>

<p>Again, if anything's funny, check <code>tail /var/log/minetest/minetest.log</code> for
information about your server.</p>

<h1>Mods</h1>

<p>Mods are deployed by the same process as games, but with an extra feature - each
mod is referenced by the World.  You can see this in the Minetest gui when
configuring a world - you've a long list of mods you can toggle on and off.  In
the file-structure, enter your <code>worlds/worldname</code> folder and open <code>world.mt</code> in
Nano (<code>sudo nano world.mt</code>).  Then to enable a mod that's been installed into
your <code>mods</code> folder, add a line to the file stating <code>load_mod_&lt;modname&gt; = true</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.minetest.net/Installing_Mods">More information on this process is
here</a></p>

<h1>More Worlds!</h1>

<p>At this point we've covered most of the ways running a minetest server is
different from running it locally and so you're off to the races... but what if
you want to run more than one?</p>

<p>This is where we go back into working with Debian/systemd.  In order to run more
worlds, we're going to run a second minetest-server instance.</p>

<h2>Fixing the Minetest World Folder</h2>

<p>Okay, first we need to get into the weeds.  By default minetest runs the world
named <code>world</code>, right?  That is, the world located at
<code>/var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/worlds/2-mineclone-survival/</code>, right?</p>

<p><strong><em>WRONG</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Minetest-server by default <em>names</em> the folder "world".  But what it actually runs
is "the only world folder in <code>/var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/worlds/</code>".
What does that mean if there's 2 folders in
<code>/var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/worlds/</code>?  Crashy crashy.  And we're going
to put a second world in there!  So before we do that, we have to make the
implicit explicit and tell minetest where to find our <em>first</em> world.</p>

<p>Before we start, </p>

<pre><code>sudo systemctl stop minetest-server
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, we're ready to operate.</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/minetest/minetest.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Now, look for <code>map-dir</code> and set it as follows</p>

<pre><code>map-dir = /var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/worlds/world/
</code></pre>

<p>Now it no longer has to <em>guess</em> where to find the world, it has an exact
location.  So we can create a 2nd world-folder and not confuse it.</p>

<pre><code>sudo systemctl start minetest-server
</code></pre>

<p>And check to make sure everything's hunky dory with our existing server.</p>

<h2>Creating a new Config File</h2>

<p>To get started on our 2nd world, we need to create a new config file.  We
already have <code>/etc/minetest/minetest.conf</code>, we're going to be copying that file
into a new 2nd file for our 2nd minetest server instance.  We can name it
whatever we like, but I like to name my worlds starting with their port number.
This is going to run on port 30002, so we'll call it <code>2-mineclone-survival</code>,
since our first world was creative.  Well, mine was.  If yours wasn't, feel free
to make your 2nd world whatever else.</p>

<pre><code>sudo cp /etc/minetest/minetest.conf /etc/minetest/2-mineclone-survival.conf
sudo nano /etc/minetest/2-mineclone-survival.conf
</code></pre>

<p>This will create our 2nd file and edit it.  This will work much the same as the
first time <em>except</em> we need to give it a new world-folder since our other
world-folder is already in use, and set a port.</p>

<p>First, look for <code>port</code> and set it as follows</p>

<pre><code>port = 30002
</code></pre>

<p>Next, look for <code>map-dir</code> and set it as follows</p>

<pre><code>map-dir = /var/games/minetest-server/.minetest/worlds/2-mineclone-survival/
</code></pre>

<p>Now, my world is named <code>2-mineclone-survival</code> but you do you.  Now, mineclone
doesn't need to edit this file, so we don't have to <code>chmod</code> or <code>chown</code> it or
anything.  That file is ready.</p>

<h2>Forwarding ports</h2>

<p>Remember earlier I told you that you <em>had</em> to forward 30000, but I recommended
doing 30000-30010?  If you didn't take my advice, take it now.  We're setting up
a service on 30002, you need to forward that on your router.</p>

<h2>Creating your 2nd world</h2>

<p>So, next step is up to you.  If you want to let minetest <em>create</em> your 2nd world
for you, it should do that based on the settings in your conf file.  I haven't
tried that.  But if you have opinions on seed and want to hand-craft it in the
minetest client, then you can go through the previous process of deploying the
world into <code>2-mineclone-survival</code>.  Create it, move it into place, <code>chown</code> it,
etc.</p>

<h2>Registering the Server</h2>

<p>There's a simple command to create a 2nd server-instance:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl start minetest-server@2-mineclone-survival.service
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that I've used "2-mineclone-survival" again.  That name <em>must</em>
match the name of your conf file.  So if you named your 2nd conf file "fred"?
<code>minetest-server@fred.service</code>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that <em>should</em> be it.  2nd world is up and running.  Go see the server
browser and you should find two worlds on your address, one on 30000 and one on
30002.</p>

<p>And you're done!</p>
