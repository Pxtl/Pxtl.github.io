    <p>Well, it's been a 4 month hiatus from cocktails, seems like a good time to start
mixing new drinks again.  I've picked up a stack of new ingredients, so this is
fairly exciting.</p>

<h1>14 Days of Cocktails</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>I want you to imagine drinking a sweet and bitter syrup made of orange rinds and
sugar.  Then, about 3.5 seconds later, somebody punches you in the face.</p>

<p>That's right, Covid Cocktails 6, day 1:  I bought some Campari and made myself a
<strong>Negroni</strong>.</p>

<p>I bought better red vermouth too.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 oz Campari</li>
<li>1 oz red vermouth (Dolin)</li>
<li>1 oz dry gin (Collective Arts)</li>
</ul>

<p>mix with ice, pour to glass with ice, serve with an orange twist.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/negroni.jpg" alt="Negroni" /></p>

<p>This is a shockingly complex drink, and hard to approach.  Unlike the off
raisin-y Dillon's red vermouth I used before, the Dolin is indescribably weird.
The bitter aftertaste of the Campari is overwhelming even in only 1/3 of the
drink.</p>

<p>Conversely, I completely see its appeal as an aperitif.  To break up sips of
this twisted concoction, I made myself a tray of oranges and cheese and crackers
and everything tastes <em>amazing</em> when you're eating it between sips of the evil
fluid.</p>

<p>I've a 750ml bottle of the Campari, and the Dolin is now open in my fridge, so
I'm going to acquire this acquired taste if it kills me.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>Covid Cocktails 6, Day 2: I like bourbon. It's sweet and caramelly and easy for
mixing. But the bourbon-making southern states like Kentucky have been
implementing a raft of anti-trans laws. So I bought Crown Royal Blender's Select
instead.</p>

<p>C.R. Blender's Select isn't a bourbon - legally it can't be.  But it's a
90-proof Canadian whiskey with both that Canadian rye flavor and a strong
bourbon-style caramel-corn flavor. Basically it straddles the border. Pricey,
though.</p>

<p>In typical CR style, it's too darned sweet.</p>

<p>So, I made a <strong>whiskey sour</strong> to try the not-bourbon.  And to change it up from
previous whiskey sours, I made it <strong>vegan</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 oz CR Blender's Select</li>
<li>1 oz lemon</li>
<li>0.25 oz simple syrup (note that it's less than usual)</li>
<li>1 oz evil-smelling slime from the chickpea can</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake vigorously without ice. Then shake vigorously with ice, double-strain to
glass.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/vegan-whiskey-sour.jpg" alt="Vegan Whiskey Sour" /></p>

<p>Sooo good. Wife turned up her nose at the thought of aquafaba in a drink, but
egg-whites don't sound better to her. For what it's worth, you can't taste the
chickpea. What you can taste is balanced tangy butterscotch rye-y creamy
goodness.  Very easy to drink.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>Covid cocktails 6, day 3.  I bring out the cassis again for a <strong>Cassis Bramble</strong>, which is basically a gin sour with berry liqueur.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 oz Collective Arts rhubarb hibiscus gin</li>
<li>1 oz lemon</li>
<li>O.25 oz simple</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake, pour over crushed ice, </p>

<p>add</p>

<ul>
<li>0.75 oz crème de cassis</li>
</ul>

<p>Garnish with a lemon wedge &amp; a cherry (supposed to be a blackberry but just ran
out).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/cassis-bramble.jpg" alt="Cassis Bramble" /></p>

<p>It was okay... I think the crème de cassis just isn't sweet enough to fill this
role. Too dry for a berry drink, mostly tasted gin and lemon. Canonically
bramble's supposed to call for crème de mure (blackberry liqueur) but you can't
get that here - this is apparently a common substitution, but black currants
sure aren't blackberries.</p>

<h2>Day 4</h2>

<p>Covid cocktails 6, day 4: Another attempt with the Campari, this time a little
more gently, with an <strong>Americano</strong>.</p>

<p>Simple 3-ingredient cocktail, build in a glass over ice:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 oz Campari</li>
<li>1.5 oz sweet vermouth</li>
</ul>

<p>Top with club soda, mix gently.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/americano.jpg" alt="Americano" /></p>

<p>Okay, the Campari is growing on me.  I still don't love it, but in this milder
context it was definitely drinkable.  The vermouth brings a sweetness makes it a
little soda-y, and there's a hint of grapefruit/orange citrus coming from the
Campari, but also lots of bitterness and earthiness.</p>

<p>I can work with this.  I when I started getting lower into the glass I had to
mix in more soda to dilute away the shocking bitterness, but I can work with it.</p>

<p>So yeah, this might be a good way to get used to Campari and the weird earthy
vermouth gradually.</p>

<h2>Day 5</h2>

<p>Covid Cocktails 6, day 5: This is a mash-up of a few different recipes I
googled. <strong>Blueberry Gin and Tonic</strong>, using Dixon's Wicked Blueberry Gin.</p>

<p>In a shaker add</p>

<ul>
<li>3 mint leaves</li>
<li>1 oz fresh blueberries</li>
<li>Juice from half a lime</li>
<li>2 oz blueberry gin</li>
</ul>

<p>Muddle the mint and blueberries</p>

<p>Slosh lightly (no need for a full shake) then double-strain to an ice-filled
glass and top with tonic to taste.  </p>

<p>Stir a little, then garnish with a twist of lime, a few blueberries, and a sprig
of mint (slap the mint to release it's nose).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/blueberry-gin-and-tonic.jpg" alt="Blueberry gin-and-tonic" /></p>

<p>It's bright and fruity and minty without being sweet, and the gin and tonic
bring a bitter undertone.  My wife loved it, and says she wants me to make it
again on a hot summer day.</p>

<h2>Day 6</h2>

<p>It's May!  That means the Kentucky Derby!  Which is apparently a horse race
thing? But also involves mint juleps!</p>

<p>Covid Cocktails 6, day 6: <strong>The Mint Julep</strong>.</p>

<p>In a metal cup, add:</p>

<ul>
<li>A dozen leaves mint,</li>
<li>3oz (!) Bourbon (or CR Blender's Select Not-Bourbon)</li>
<li>0.5 oz simple syrup</li>
<li>2 dashes angostura bitters</li>
</ul>

<p>Muddle, let steep for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Then fill half full of crushed ice, swizzle, and fill the rest of the way with
crushed ice. Add a small dash of Jamaican rum, slap a bouquet of mint to release
its nose and use it for garnish, and add a straw.  Let it sit for a few more
minutes to build up frost.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/mint-julep.jpg" alt="Mint Julep" /></p>

<p>okay, let it sit for <em>more</em> than a few minutes.  First sip was straight
sweetened bourbon with a touch of mint.  Let it melt and the bourbon softens and
the mint expresses and it's icy and minty.  In the end, it just tastes like
sweet mint, ice, and whiskey, but that's pretty good.</p>

<h2>Day 7</h2>

<p>For Covid cocktails 6, day 7, here comes the story of the <strong>Hurricane</strong>.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's a nice passionfruit thing.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 oz white rum</li>
<li>1 oz dark rum</li>
<li>1 oz orange juice</li>
<li>1 oz lime juice</li>
<li>2 oz passionfruit juice</li>
<li>2 barspoons grenadine</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake, with ice, pour over ice, garnish with lime &amp; cherry</p>

<p>I had to make some substitutions - couldn't get proper passion fruit puree or
syrup, much less the traditional tropical fruit mix that's supposed to be used,
so I used passionfruit juice cocktail and doubled the amount.  But it still had
a strong passionfruit flavor. Also, I'm using Dillon's Niagara grenadine (mixed
local fruit, no pom).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/hurricane.jpg" alt="Hurricane" /></p>

<p>This is an incredibly tasty and easy to drink cocktail.  I made some
substitutions so I don't know how authentic it is, but it's definitely a drink
that could get somebody in a lot of trouble on the streets of New Orleans.</p>

<h2>Day 8</h2>

<p>Covid cocktails 6, day 8: We return to Campari for the <strong>Garibaldi</strong>, a simple low-alcohol 2-ingredient cocktail.</p>

<p>Prepare 4 oz of foamed orange juice.</p>

<p>1.5 oz Campari in a glass, add 2 oz of foamed OJ and some ice, mix, then pour
the rest of the foamed OJ in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/garibaldi.jpg" alt="Garibaldi" /></p>

<p>This is nice.  Mild, sweet and bitter... like sweet fluffy grapefruit with a
strange earthy undertone.</p>

<p>I used a milk foamer to foam the OJ, but a blender or whisk or even a dry shake
should do it.  Should've strained the pulp first - cleaning pulp of milk foamer
sucked.</p>

<p>Apparently the ideal OJ for this is fresh-pressed blood orange, but I used
regular concentrate cans and it was good this way too.</p>

<h2>Day 9</h2>

<p>Covid Cocktails 6, day 9: To mark Star Wars day... I did nothing topical 'cause
it's also my kid's birthday and I'm busy enough, thanks.</p>

<p>I made another <strong>Manhattan</strong>.  This time it was actually good.</p>

<p>In a mixing glass, combine with ice:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 oz sweet vermouth</li>
<li>1.75 oz bourbon</li>
<li>2 dashes angostura bitters</li>
<li>1 dash orange bitters</li>
</ul>

<p>mix, strain to a chilled glass,</p>

<p>garnish with a brandied cherry</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/manhattan-2.jpg" alt="Manhattan" /></p>

<p>I really liked it... the cherry nose and mix of complex flavours from the
bitters and the vermouth combine wonderfully and the sweetness keeps any of the
bittering parts from being overpowering.  It was just plain nice.  The detailed
flavors are... kind of indescribable.</p>

<h3>Relevant How To Drink Video on Manhattans</h3>

<p>This is the "Manhattan Matrix" episode of HTD where he breaks down various
vermouths and whiskeys... but he tries so many combinations thereof he gets
himself alcohol poisoning.  So it's simultaneously educational, entertaining,
and an important cautionary tale.</p>

<h2>Day 10</h2>

<p>Covid cocktails 6, day 10.  I've got no tequila, so no Cinco de Mayo theme.
Instead, I made a <strong>Painkiller</strong>, which is like a more cocktail-y piña colada.</p>

<p>In a shaker:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 oz pineapple juice</li>
<li>1 oz cream of coconut</li>
<li>1 oz white rum</li>
<li>1 oz dark rum</li>
<li>1 oz OJ</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake with ice, open pour to glass.</p>

<p>... when open-pouring I still had to grab my big ice and keep it out or it
would've overfilled the glass.  This is a bigger drink.</p>

<p>Top with some fresh grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>For the "cream of coconut" I can't find anybody who carries Coco Lopez sweetened
cream of coconut, so I made my own by heating half a can of coconut cream and
adding 3/4 cup of sugar.  Avoid boiling, just heat until clarified then jar it.
Apparently real stuff has stronger coconut taste.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/painkiller.jpg" alt="Painkiller" /></p>

<p>This is shockingly easy to drink.  Sweet and fruity and the nutmeg adds a nice
nose.  The coconut, pineapple, and orange blend really well.  The alcohol is
basically invisible, with only a bare hint of the funk coming from the dark rum.</p>

<p>This is nice, because I spent the last few days trying and failing to get a
proper piña colada right using a mix of pineapple juice and frozen pineapples,
and the texture just wasn't coming out right.  I kinda needed the win.</p>

<h2>Day 11</h2>

<p>Covid Cocktails 6 day 11: A <strong>Hanky Panky</strong>.</p>

<p>In a mixing glass, combine with ice:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 oz sweet vermouth</li>
<li>1.5 oz London dry gin</li>
<li>2 bar spoons Fernet Branca</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir, strain to a chilled glass.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/hanky-panky.jpg" alt="Hanky Panky" /></p>

<p>It's cough syrup.  Really nice cough syrup with a nice fruity tinge from the
vermouth.  The herbal flavors from the gin and vermouth and Fernet make it
pretty medicinal... but it definitely has its charms.</p>

<p>But still cough syrup.</p>

<h2>Day 12</h2>

<p>Covid cocktails 6, day 12: let's do more cough syrup!  A <strong>boulevardier</strong>.</p>

<p>In a mixing glass, with ice:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 oz bourbon</li>
<li>1 oz Campari</li>
<li>1 oz red vermouth</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir, strain to a glass with ice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/boulevardier.jpg" alt="Boulevardier" /></p>

<p>I think I'm now acclimatized to Campari.  At first the bitter aftertaste was
ruining a nice orangey Manhattan, but as I got further into the glass I really
got to like it. I gave my wife a sip.  She puckered so hard I thought her face
might implode.</p>

<h2>Day 13</h2>

<p>Covid Cocktails 6, day 13: I made some cinnamon simple syrup, and used that to
make a <strong>Cinnamon Old-Fashioned</strong>.</p>

<p>To make cinnamon simple syrup: simmer 4 sticks of cinnamon in 1 cup of water,
covered, for 10 minutes, then add 1.5 cups of sugar. Cool in fridge covered for
6 hours, then strain and jar. </p>

<p>The cinnamon old fashioned is just </p>

<ul>
<li>2 oz of rye </li>
<li>0.5 oz of cinnamon </li>
<li>a couple of dashes of angostura</li>
</ul>

<p>Build in a glass, stir with a sphere of ice, garnish with another cinnamon
stick.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/cinnamon-old-fashioned.jpg" alt="Cinnamon Old-Fashioned" /></p>

<p>Nice, easy drink.  The spices of the angostura and the natural baking-spice
flavor of the rye blend quite well with the cinnamon.  It has a charming,
Christmas-y flavor.  If you like cinnamon this is an easy drink to make.  This'd
make a good hot toddy too.</p>

<h2>Day 14</h2>

<p>Covid cocktails 6, day 14.  For my finale this might be a bit on the nose but: a
Quarantine Order.</p>

<p>In a shaker, combine</p>

<ul>
<li>3 oz Jamaican rum</li>
<li>1 oz lime juice</li>
<li>1 oz grapefruit juice</li>
<li>1.5 oz passionfruit juice</li>
<li>0.5 oz cinnamon syrup</li>
<li>5 dashes angostura</li>
</ul>

<p>Shake for 30s, free pour to glass,</p>

<p>Garnish with mint, cherry, and lime.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2021-05-15-Covid-cocktails-6/quarantine-order.jpg" alt="quarantine-order" /></p>

<p>I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all, even after adding more.  Then tried with a
straw and quickly realized that all the cinnamon syrup went straight to the
bottom.</p>

<p>Nice fruity cinnamon drink but I think I used too much ice.</p>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>This particular round was an education on the subject of ingredients and
quality.  I watched through the "How To Drink" video on manhattans and picked a
vermouth that he recommended (before going to the hospital to get his stomach
pumped from alcohol poisoning - stay safe out there, kids).  Sadly the <em>best</em>
sweet Italian vermouths aren't available at the LCBO - Punt e Mes and Antica
Formula are pretty consistently top of the list... but the Dolin sweet vermouth
made all the difference from my previous attempts with it.</p>

<p>Likewise, switching from traditional Canadian whiskeys to a bourbon (well,
bourbon-like Canadian whiskey) really helped the drinks that demanded a sweeter,
less rye-heavy base spirit.</p>

<p>And Campari is definitely... interesting to work with.  If you like the shocking
bitterness of grapefruit I'd say you should give it a try.</p>

<p>Favorites this time through were the <strong>vegan whiskey sour</strong>, the <strong>blueberry
G&amp;T</strong> (my wife's favorite) and the <strong>painkiller</strong>.  Honorable mention go to the
<strong>Garibaldi</strong>, the <strong>Americano</strong>, and the <strong>boulevardier</strong> for warming me up to
the Campari.</p>
