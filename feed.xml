&lt;a href="https://www.minetest.net"&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Preamble&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my daughter is really into Minecraft, in typical sense that saying "really
into" understates the situation.  I looked into getting Minecraft, but the
challenge with Minecraft is that there is a different, separately purchased
version of Minecraft for each platform and not all of them are compatible with
each other.  Also, I tend to prefer software that I can rule like an iron-fisted
overlord instead of trusting The Cloud, which now handles "modern" minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I looked into an open-source reimplementation of Minecraft called Minetest
that I'd been studiously ignoring, created by hobbyists.  The good news was that
it looked like it would meet my needs.  The bad news was that the installation
process was a lot to ask of parents.  So, a 2-part party was planned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a Zoom meeting to say happy-birthday and blow out the candles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who had gotten through the install-and-config process, a Minetest
sandbox for the kids to play in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Zoom Party&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you sing Happy Birthday and blow out candles and eat cake at a
birthday party spread across about a dozen households?  Simple, with Zoom, and
&lt;a href="http://www.westdalecupcakes.com/"&gt;Cupcakes of Westdale Village&lt;/a&gt;.  This created
a fun wrinkle that all the children got to order their own personal flavour of
cupcake (and a 2nd-choice in case there was a problem).  So, the day before the
party, we gloved up and put on our masks and delivered cupcakes and goodie bags
to all of our attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cupcakes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/2020-05-05-Minetest-birthday/cupcake.jpg" alt="Cupcake" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we had to go back to the shop to  replace a few of the cupcakes
because my son did not understand that (a) the boxes are not sealed shut, and
(b) they have to stay right-side-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every goody-bag included a candle as well, so every child got to blow out their
own cake as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zoom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zoom software actually impresses me, mostly because I've been working with a
lot of the alternatives and they're kind of awful.  A gallery full of screaming
kids, and not using proper headsets, and it works pretty well.  Doing the same
with Mumble creates a nightmarish feedback loop that will feel like being
stabbed in the ear.  Sometimes the audio seems to kick in late, and there's a
lot of latency, and it seems to have a perverse and inexplicable logic for
picking volume for the kids, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom seems to be consistently dropping the 40 minute limit for free accounts
over the weekends, which was a big help.  Honestly the biggest thing that
impresses me with zoom, at least on desktop, is that they eschew the normal
setup of accounts and logins and all that process - you download an exe for the
meeting you've been invited to and you're rolling.  No setting up a username and
password, no entering in a meeting ID.  It was the one bit of tech we didn't
have to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/2020-05-05-Minetest-birthday/zoom_cupcakes.jpg" alt="Zoom Cupcakes" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids were ecstatic to see each other.  It was fun for them to catch up,
although it's hard for them to manage a conversation in such a massive group.
They sang happy birthday, although the latency in Zoom makes it mathematically
impossible for anybody to keep in time so it just sounds like shouting.  A great
time was had by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we started up the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Planning The Minetest Party&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Pi4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's my wife's fault, really.  She bought me a Raspberry Pi 3b a year or two ago
and I've gotten the Single-Board Computer bug.  A computer that can do all sorts
of things costs less than almost any individual game I bought as a kid.  I've
since converted my old Pi 3b into a Nintendo emulator for my father-in-law, and
upgraded to a trio of Pi 4 devices for various purposes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these Pi 4s lives under my chest of drawers in my bedroom alongside the
wifi access-point and the Phillips Hue box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/2020-05-05-Minetest-birthday/pi4.jpg" alt="The Pi 4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine a really wierd version of Toy Story under there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the curious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2GB Raspberry Pi4 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32GB microSD card (some name-brand one - never buy no-name SDs on Amazon,
they'll only break your heart)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official USB power-supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miuzei air-cooled case kit (includes heatsinks and fan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case was fun, despite being a no-name Chinese one.  We made two of these.
My son has always fantasized about building a gaming PC so this got him screwing
parts together and taping on the heatsinks onto the Pi4 devices.  The Miuzei
only cost a two bucks more than the "official" Pi4 case and it looks better and
has a nice silent fan to cool it for overclocking (I don't overclock this one
but the other one I made for my brother is overclocked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son named it Kosmos.  It runs our Minetest world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up Minetest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.minetest.net"&gt;Minetest&lt;/a&gt; is a free, open-source copy of Minecraft made
by hobbyists.  For fans of Minecraft: yeah, it's a pale shadow of the original.
The problem is that Minecraft has a proliferation of versions.  Tablet versions,
two different PC versions, and two different incompatible server versions for
running worlds. All sold separately.  I didn't want to have to figure out which
version which kids had and figure out what to do there... And worse, the newer
"bedrock" version doesn't let me run the world on my own hardware, and I insist
on ruling my childrens' game-worlds like an iron-fisted despot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I gave the hobby-made imitation a try... and found that after installing a
"subgame" called &lt;a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=16407"&gt;MineClone 2&lt;/a&gt;
that makes it a more complete imitation of MineCraft (the stock Minetest subgame
doesn't include animals and monsters), it was a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hardcore minecraft fans: Mineclone 2 is a pale imitation.  The graphics are
a bit uglier, it's a bit slower, the monsters are dumber, animals keep walking
into the river and floating away, there are gaps in the gameplay, and there's no
villages.  But for people who just want to build houses and have a stable of
rabbits, it's more than good enough.  Especially in just "Creative mode" which
turns the game into more interactive lego than an actual game with objectives
and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge with minetest is the installation process: it doesn't have
one.  The game is packed up as a raw zip file and you unzip it on your machine.
You have to suss out that the executable lives in the "bin" folder (which makes
perfect sense to nobody but us programmers), and when you run the exe you'll
have to agree to numerous Windows warnings about this unsigned, unverified
program that has been unceremoniously dumped into a folder on your computer and
is asking for network privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Mineclone 2 also lacks an installation process, but in a good
way: you just connect to my Minetest world and you'll automatically download
Mineclone 2.  Along with the 90 or so skins I've installed into it for the kids
to choose from.  And any other mods the server is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/2020-05-05-Minetest-birthday/screenshot_20200503_142525.jpg" alt="Minetest Group Screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mineclone 2/Minetest also has an in-game skin-picker and lets you choose your
name.  This seems like a small thing but I've seen too many games of Minecraft
where somebody is borrowing their brother's account or something and nobody
knows who they are because it shows the wrong name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up Mumble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another server running on my little Pi4 is &lt;a href="https://www.mumble.info/"&gt;Mumble&lt;/a&gt;.  Mumble is a wonderful
open-source voicechat system designed for gaming.  It's fast, low-resource,
low-latency and has a wonderful configuration wizard where it talks you through
getting your computer's microphone configured just right to make sure all your
friends will have the best experience talking to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone &lt;strong&gt;hated&lt;/strong&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The config wizard is difficult, it has a bizarre cryptographic-key-based
authentication system, and we were unable to get it working on our friends' mac.
Most unforgivably it has no echo-cancelling to speak of so when our friends
joined in a dry-run using their straight laptop speaker and microphone instead
of a proper headset, the feedback-loop was ear-splitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll still insist it's the right tool for enthusiasts - the sound is crystal
clear and there's none of the delay that causes awkward interrupting and
cross-talk in Zoom.  But not for a birthday party, unless it's a birthday party
full of programmers and gamers where everybody has a good headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we realized that Mumble was a usability disaster, we changed the plan to
just use Zoom for the minetest game too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a four-page document for parents about the software we were using for
this party, URLs, passwords, etc.  Three of them were on Mumble.  I should've
realized it when I had to add the section about "configuring push-to-talk" but
I'm stubborn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept the Mumble server as "plan B" if Zoom didn't work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Minetest Party&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everybody could join.  I assume some parents saw the PDF I sent and noped
the heck out of doing tech-support for a 10 year old on a Sunday afternoon and I
don't blame them one bit.  But a good crowd of kids joined the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/2020-05-05-Minetest-birthday/g-gaming.jpg" alt="Daughter Playing" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a hit.  I had to furiously type teleport commands as fast as I could to
get the kids all into the same area to introduce them and give them the lay of
the land:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explain how to play and the differences between Minetest and Minecraft.
Everybody had it down inside of 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is backed up and we're reverting it after the party so anything you
make is going bye-bye.  This was mostly to prevent any tantrums if my
daughters meticulously-constructed villages got obliterated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to pick skins.  This was, of course, their first question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, apparently you can't teleport somebody out of a minecart in minetest.
This was a problem when people would not know how to dismount (look down and
rclick) and my main tool for rescuing trapped and lost kids was teleporting
them.  I had to enlist my son to be assistant-teleporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I had to juggle this and try to debug issues with people who
couldn't make it through the installation and game-joining process.  That was
hard - trying to isolate and work with one frustrated parent in a noisy Zoom
room is excruciating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/2020-05-05-Minetest-birthday/double-screenshot.jpg" alt="Full Screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note: faces of my daughters' friends redacted.  Also, this is my son's
screenshot, I was answering those support requests in chat on whisper from
another machine.  And yes, my desktop is messy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom got the job done for audio, barely.  My kids are &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt;.  I would see my
daughter grabbing the mic of her headset and practically jamming it into her
mouth to holler to her friends to come follow her and explore the underground
minecart tracks.  I kept having to explain to them that they don't have to
shout, their friends' ears are &lt;em&gt;two inches from their mouths&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed Tylenol fresh air after 20 minutes of that.  The kids went on for 2
hours, and I have no idea how they did it.  One challenge I didn't expect was
that, because this was a completely open sandbox - no challenge or objective -
the kids tended to follow just schoolyard rules of making up activities.  This
creates the usual problem with all the kids clamoring for each others'
attention, compounded by the fact that they're doing that all directly in my
ears.  I figure a more traditional online gaming format like a deathmatch
would've solved that non-objective problem but created a whole slew of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final act they had fun destroying my daughters' meticulously constructed
village with a rain of killer bunnies, lava, and explosive minecarts (see the
previous note about taking a backup of my daughters' world before we started).
I had to wipe the objects from the world multiple times because mineclone's
animals are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; coded to support large-scale use and the world would crawl
when they created too many of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/2020-05-05-Minetest-birthday/lava-and-bunnies.jpg" alt="Lava and Killer Bunnies" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, overall?  Definitely a success.  My daughter and her friends are
talking about meeting up regularly in our little mineclone world.  Meanwhile I'm
trying to figure out what game to try next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Next Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next post, I'll get into the weeds of the setup process and gotchas for getting
these servers set up on a Pi4.  Recipes!  Linux!  Sudo all the things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the details: if you don't like my guide there is also &lt;a href="http://ip-webcam.appspot.com/static/doc.html"&gt;the
official guide&lt;/a&gt; from the developer
of the tools I'm describing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your phone as a server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to get your Android phone onto a static IP. So go to Settings -&gt;
About -&gt; Status to find your Wi-fi MAC address, and in your router's DHCP/LAN
settings, you need to bind that address to a fixed IP. Also take note of &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt;
wifi network your phone lives on, if you have more than one in your home or
workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to install &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&amp;amp;hl=en_CA"&gt;IP
Webcam&lt;/a&gt;
on your android phone. This turns your phone into a video server - which is why
it needs a static IP. Run IP Webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommended settings:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP WEBCAM SETTINGS -&gt; Video Preferences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the "main" camera to the front-facing camera. I know the rear-camera is
better but this is just easier to set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the "Video Resolution" to 640x480 or lower. I found performance problems
at higher resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CONNECTION SETTINGS -&gt; Local Broadcasting
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a Login and Password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm assuming your network is secure so we're not going to fuss with SSL, I
couldn't make SSL work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just to be safe, don't get naked in front of your phone while it's running
the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notes on "run in background":&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP WebCam has the option to run in background, but I found the notification icon
that indicates this is happening easy-to-miss and so it would be very easy to
accidentally leave it broadcasting your life. It does save power because you can
shut down the video view and do other things while it's streaming, but I
recommend not using it. If power is a problem, get a power-cable for your
computer desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Starting it up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that your settings are confirmed, click "start server". It will show the
live video from your phoen that it is broadcasting, along with the address if
the webserver your phone is running - eg http://192.168.1.X:8080. Note that this
is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the address of the raw stream, but of a website you can use to
configure your device. Feel free to hit that address with your browser to try
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual video feed lives at http://192.168.1.X:8080/video. Note the /video
directory. It's over HTTP, so again you can hit it with your browser. You'll be
prompted for username and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave the server running while we set up the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your Windows PC as a client&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, confirm that your Windows PC is on the same WiFi network as your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we install the client software. We're using &lt;a href="https://ip-webcam.appspot.com/"&gt;IP Camera
Adapter&lt;/a&gt; which will allow you to connect your
Windows PC to the HTTP videostream and use it as a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install the software. When completed, open the app "Configure IP Camera Adapter"
that is now present in your start menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type in the camera feed URL - remember this is the one that ends in "/video".
So in total it should be something like http://192.168.1.X:8080/video . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key in your username and password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click "Autodetect" - this will test our connection to your phone and read in
its resolution. It should match whatever you set back in the server setup
step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now use your video-chat program of choice's "video test" tool to confirm it
works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it work? Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No? You're on your own, bud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it best to keep my video stream &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; and just keep the button to turn my
phone into a camera on my phone's home-screen. You will see a wierd backwards
text in your video-feed if your computer cannot reach the phone. So when a
videochat starts, I open the app, scroll to the bottom and click "start", and
then put my phone in place to work as a camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the camera mode does run down the battery, so it may be handy to
have a charge-cable near whatever cradle-like setup you've rigged for your phone
at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of cities that have implemented centre-aligned bike lanes.  There are some advantages to this flow: Drivers expect to see oncoming traffic on the left.  In one-way traffic like Cannon, this means putting the cycle track on the left side (south for Cannon).  In a two-way street, this means using the centre - it's on the left for both directions of traffic.  This allows us to unify the two bike lanes into a  single protected bidirectional cycle track without having oncoming traffic on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a feature very particular to York and Cannon; Cannon merges with York Boulevard at Queen to form a single road.  The Cannon lanes, if continued, would end in the centre of this road.  So let's see what that looks like: The Cannon lanes continue right to Queen, and only have to deal with left-turning traffic turning across the bike lane.  &lt;/p&gt;

So let's see what that looks like: The Cannon lanes continue right to Queen, and only have to deal with left-turning traffic turning across the bike lane.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_queennoboxes.jpg" alt="picture of straight-through bike-lane at York/Queen/Cannon" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to cross York or Cannon to continue on the track.  Since the left-turn signals are already in a separate phase, that means &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; unexpected interactions between the bike lane and drivers for straight-through cyclists.  Of course, a "yield to bikes" sign is needed for the uncontrolled left-turn at the U-Turn slip road from Cannon to eastbound York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;York also offers a particular advantage that its massive tree-lined grassy median will provide a refuge for cyclists; a bit of greenery and safe space in a ride that's otherwise a bit intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't some zany invention.  Other cities have noticed the merits of a bike track in the middle of a bi-directional road - all the cyclists are in one place, and oncoming traffic is on the left.  Contrast that to two side-aligned bike lanes (one in each direction) which suffer conflicts with parking and space issues.  Alternately, a bi-directional cycle track on the side of the road means oncoming traffic in a very unexpected place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks too - it makes turning for cyclists much more difficult.  Every turn requires crossing the car lanes, possibly with a bike box.  And it only works if drivers can only go left at an explicit left-turn-signal, or else left-turns are going across a bike lane, which in the case of York could be very unexpected since the "left hook" zone would be very hard for a westbound driver to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other cities with centre-aligned bike lanes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable street with a centre-aligned cycle track is easily one of the most notable streets in the world: Pennsylvania Avenue, in DC.  The street with the White House on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at that jerk blocking the bike lane with his big limo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/1024px-Barack_Obama_and_Michelle_Obama_in_inaugural_parade_01-21-13.jpg" alt="Obama inauguration" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image from Wikimedia Commons and is public-domain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the need for parades on Pennsylvania, they can't put proper protections on ther bike lane.  York Boulevard is a lot of things, but not a parade route.  So we don't have that limitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_pennsylvania_crossing.jpg" alt="Google Streetview Image of Pennsylvania Ave bike lanes with intersection showing crossing sign" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking closer, most of the intersections on Pennsylvania advise turning cyclists just to cross in crosswalks - topologically this is practically identical to a bike box, but lets the city focus on their nice, presentable concrete crossings.  Where no concrete exists, a slightly-unorthodox bike box is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_pennsylvania_bikebox.jpg" alt="Google Streetview Image of Pennsylvania Ave bike lanes with bike box" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another city with centre bike lanes is NYC.  Brooklyn sports a centre-aligned track on Sands St, leading to the bikeway on the Manhattan Bridge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_sandsbikeway.jpg" alt="Google Streetview Image of Sands bike track protected" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to protect these centre bikeways shines here. 
 Again we see some use of bike boxes for turning movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_sandsbikebox.jpg" alt="Google Streetview Image of Sands bike track bike box" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some challenges to York.  Without tearing out all the concrete and some traffic signals, the route will be slightly awkward at intersections.  We'll be repurposing the eastbound left-turn lanes, which are curved for left turns and so diverge somewhat from the straight path.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_lockeintersection.jpg" alt="map of Locke intersection" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_queenintersection.jpg" alt="map of Queen intersection" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the unprotected left turn lanes that exist for minor intersections - one for Rolph's Gate, one for Oxford, and one for the Cannon-&gt;York U-turn.  Ultimately there's no good solution for those besides the same "yield to cyclists" sign we already see for left turns along the Cannon track.  The city used a more unorthodox structure on King and Paradise in Westdale which is a part of my regular commute, and it seems to cause nothing but confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pxtl.ca/images/yorkcentrebikelanes_paradiseintersection.jpg" alt="Google Streetview Image of Paradise intersection" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we'll be consistent - on the eastbound side of York, the leftmost lane and the turn-lanes are now the cycle track, where a turn lane is present, we'll use the now-available next lane as the turn lane.  So the experience should be nearly unchanged for eastbound drivers, they're just turning from a new turning lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places for overhanging "Yield to cyclists" signs are marked with a yellow car symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, some concrete will need to be reworked - to allow cyclists to turn, we need bike boxes at Queen, Dundurn, and Locke... but there's a concrete and grass median in the way.  Adding ramps or flattening it is the best option, since the crosswalks aren't wide enough to work as half-cross-walks, half-bike-boxes.  Bike boxes are never ideal, since it means the cyclist has to wait for a full cycle to turn.  In this case, both left turns and right turns require a full cycle, cyclists even have to turn right to get into the leftwards bike box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, accessing minor roads will obviously invite cyclists to dart across traffic.  Being able to turn only at Locke and Queen isn't anybody's favourite option.  Particularly since York's median has lowered concrete ramps for pedestrians at minor intersections, cyclists will obviously feel invited to use those.  There's no good answer besides "wait for your gap".  Side-aligned bike lanes do not have this problem for right turns, but they double it for left ones.&lt;/p&gt;
