    <p>So in a fit of pettiness, the Government of Ontario is set to wrap up bike-lanes
in a 50-foot-ball of red tape to prevent their construction.  I asked on Bluesky
what was the best way to complain - if there was a petition I should sign or
something.  Craig Burley recommended I send a <em>fax</em> of all things.  It's got a
good chance of being physical media in their space, and won't just be in a
slushpile of emails they ignore, or forgettable names on a petition.  So I wrote
up the letters for the Premier and the Minister of Transportation at lunch on
Tuesday and faxed them from my local UPS store.  Also emailed them for good measure.</p>

<p>The bodies of the letters are attached below.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<h2>First, to Premier Ford</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Honourable Premier of Ontario Doug Ford<br />
  Legislative Building<br />
  Queen's Park<br />
  Toronto ON M7A 1A1  </p>
  
  <p>Dear Premier,</p>
  
  <p>I am a father of three who lives in Hamilton. I am a regular cycling commuter
  (yes, even in winter), from a family of cyclists, and have taught and equipped
  my children to use their bikes for travel as well. When my kids were younger, a
  bike-trailer is how I got them to school and to their daycare. I hope this
  conveys that this is not about recreation - this is me living my life.  My
  interest is about protecting my children and being able to care for them.</p>
  
  <p>The bike-lanes that enable this were carved out of existing roadways, and so
  they would be covered under Bill 212. The new Keddy Access Trail lane (named for
  a kindergarten teacher and cyclist killed in a hit-and-run) allows me to get up
  the escarpment to my doctor’s office instead of having to take a taxi. Each of
  these lanes were a battle in Hamilton’s city council to obtain - adding new red
  tape to this process will likely push such improvements out of reach, which
  harms the safety and freedom of myself and my children.</p>
  
  <p>And speaking of red tape, I’m not one who opposes this change on democratic
  grounds - I truly believe the province should overrule the municipal governments
  on some matters, as is your right.  But when I worry about my kids, it’s not
  whether they’ll be able to travel fast-enough in their cars, but whether they’ll
  be able to have homes of their own. Their own views reflect this - they are
  worried about ever being able to move out in our broken housing market, but
  getting my oldest to show any interest in obtaining his driver’s license has
  been like pulling teeth.</p>
  
  <p>The Housing Affordability Task Force emphatically told the province what to do
  to fix the housing crisis, explaining which municipal rules and processes need
  to be overridden top-down to get homes built… and yet instead of that critical
  cost-of-living crisis, you’re focusing on bike lanes of all things?  The tiny
  handful of HATF recommendations that were embraced have been scaled back to
  almost nothing, and the remaining lion’s share are completely unapplied.  Where
  are the as-of-right intensification rules?  Where is shutting down the ability
  of busybodies to block the construction of critically needed homes?  Are there
  not enough people living in tents already?</p>
  
  <p>To be blunt: Why do we see this power and enthusiasm spent on removing a
  nuisance from your commute, instead of fixing life-ruining problems?</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for your time,</p>
  
  <p>Martin Zarate</p>

<h2>Second, to Transportation Minister Sarkaria</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Honourable Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Singh Sarkaria</p>
  
  <p>Ministry of Transportation</p>
  
  <p>5th Floor</p>
  
  <p>777 Bay St.</p>
  
  <p>Toronto, ON M7A 1Z8</p>
  
  <p>Dear Minister,</p>
  
  <p>I am a father of three who lives in Hamilton. I am a regular cycling commuter
  (yes, even in winter), from a family of cyclists, and have taught and equipped
  my children to use their bikes for travel as well. When my kids were younger, a
  bike-trailer is how I got them to school and to their daycare. My kids used
  these bike lanes to get to summer day-camp programs.I hope this conveys that
  this is not about recreation - this is my family living our lives. My interest
  is about protecting my children and being able to care for them.</p>
  
  <p>The bike-lanes that enable this life were carved out of existing roadways, and
  so they would be covered under Bill 212. The new Keddy Access Trail lane (named
  for a kindergarten teacher and cyclist killed in a hit-and-run) allows me to
  get up the escarpment to my doctor’s office instead of having to take a taxi.
  Each of these lanes were a battle in Hamilton’s city council to obtain - adding
  new red tape to this process will likely push such improvements out of reach,
  which harms the safety and freedom of myself and my children.</p>
  
  <p>And speaking of red tape, I’m not one who opposes this change on democratic
  grounds - I truly believe the province should overrule the municipal
  governments on some matters, as is your right. But when I worry about my kids,
  it’s not whether they’ll be able to travel fast-enough in their cars, but
  whether they’ll be able to have homes of their own. Their own views reflect
  this - they are worried about ever being able to move out in our broken housing
  market, but getting my oldest to show any interest in obtaining his driver’s
  licence has been like pulling teeth.</p>
  
  <p>Surely the Ministry could be focusing on other things? All over Ontario we’ve
  watched critical public transit projects get bogged down in over a dozen years
  of delays. Why does an LRT line take a decade when destroying active transit
  apparently takes a few days? Where is this excitement and motivation on those
  matters? To me, this sounds like a problem of priorities in the Ministry of
  Transportation.</p>
  
  <p>The Ministry of Transportation could be making Ontario healthier, greener,
  safer, and easier to get around. Instead, bill 212 proposes to do the exact
  opposite.  I hope you’ll reconsider this plan, it is literally a matter of
  life-and-death for my family.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for your time,</p>
  
  <p>Martin Zarate</p>
